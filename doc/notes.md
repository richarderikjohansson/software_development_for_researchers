# Notes on lectures and homework assignments 

## Lectures notes 

## Homework assignment 0: Development environment

**Install git**
1. If git is not installed on your system (try git --version), install it (remember to always favor your package manager) and create a new repository for homework solutions.
2. If you want - upload the repo on codeberg, github, or gitlab.
**Virtual environments**
1. Choose a method to manage virtual environments and implement it, write a cheat sheet for creating, entering, exiting and deleting environments.
**Editor mastery**
1. Go trough the shortcuts that your chosen editors has, create a short cheat sheet for the shortcuts that you think are the most useful!


## Homework assignment 1: Motivation

**Software inventory**
Create a list of:
1. Code that you depend on and use and why
2. Code that you have written, what it is and how its used 
3. Code you are going to write, what it is and who will use it


## Homework assignment 2: Programming

1. Create a small python package. 
2. Install your package into your virtual environment.
3. Create 2 functions in two separate modules inside 
   your package. One function should reverse a list and
   the other should take two lists as input, reverse the  
   first list and then interleave every other argument of 
   two lists outputting a single new list. You should import
   the list-reveral function from the other module 
   (hint: intra-package-references).
4. Create a scripts in a different location than were the 
   package is that uses this function from the package to interleave
   the following two strings: 'VOG!lo olH' and 'el,Wrd ROY'.
5. Implement a function in your package that uses the following: 
   f-strings, with, and encode / decode to save or load an input string
   in a binary file.
6. Install matplotlib into your environment.
   Implement one of the [https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/fill_between_alpha.html#sphx-glr-gallery-lines-bars-and-markers-fill-between-alpha-py](examples).
   Run the code and get the plot to show.
